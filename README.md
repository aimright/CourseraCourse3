# Coursera Course 3
Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The objective of this README is to explain that the analysis file is clear and understandable. That is, the script run_analysis.R is understood by the user.

The run_analysis.R script is broken down in 8 different steps as the following:
- Step 1: Get data from 
- Step 2: Extract data
- Step 3: Combining data
- Step 4: Selecting variables
- Step 5: Using descriptive activity names
- Step 6: Using descriptive variable names
- Step 7: Creating tidy data set
- Step 8: Exporting tidy data set

The purpose of the script is to complete the following requirements:
1) Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3) Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
5) From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
